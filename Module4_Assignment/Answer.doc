Font Selection: The primary font chosen for the body text is Roboto from Google Fonts, complemented by Merriweather for the titles. 
Reasoning: The choice of Roboto, with its modern, sans-serif appearance, guarantees ease of reading on a variety of devices and screen sizes. Its straightforward lines and approachable shapes ensure clarity even in smaller sizes, accommodating a wide audience. Merriweather is selected for titles due to its serif sophistication, offering a striking contrast that aids in structuring content and improving navigation. This deliberate combination of fonts enhances the website's visual harmony and legibility, aligning with typography standards while blending accessibility with elegance.

Color Scheme:
Primary Shades: The main colors are #005A9C (Vallejo Blue) and #F2F2F2 (Light Grey).
Secondary Tones: #E63946 (Crimson) and #FFD700 (Gold) are used for accentuating important elements.

Rationale: Vallejo Blue, as the dominant color, symbolizes dependability, calmness, and consistency, reflecting the library¡¯s function as a reliable cornerstone in the community. Light Grey acts as a gentle contrast, reducing visual fatigue and making the content accessible to people of all ages. The use of Crimson for key actions, such as signing up for a library card or reserving books, draws attention due to the natural eye-catching property of red shades. Gold, on the other hand, introduces a sense of warmth and prominence to crucial information, aiding in user-friendly site navigation and enhancing the overall visual appeal.

This color strategy employs a complementary palette with blue at its heart, supported by neutral grays and warm accent colors. It creates an inviting yet refined online space, perfectly balancing friendliness with professionalism. The preference for light backgrounds with dark text aligns with best practices for accessibility and readability, serving the library¡¯s varied clientele with the highest level of inclusivity.
